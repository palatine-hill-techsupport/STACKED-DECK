      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> When you opened your first pack.</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to <strong>STACKED DECK,</strong> where fate is shuffled, the odds are weighted, and your backlog just got bigger. By accessing or using our site, you agree to these legally binding Terms of Service. Yes, even if you didn't read them. Especially if you didn't read them.</p>

      <h2>2. Acceptance of Risk</h2>
      <p>STACKED DECK is a digital entertainment platform that simulates the thrilling highs and inevitable lows of randomized game acquisition. This platform uses an intentionally unbalanced probability system (read: <em>stacked</em>) to maximize suspense, engagement, and a deep sense of sunk cost.</p>
      <p>All loot draws are final. No refunds. No regrets. Odds may change without notice, but rest assured: the house is always delighted.</p>

      <h2>3. Backlog Liability</h2>
      <p>We are not responsible for the following side effects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mounting shame from unplayed titles</li>
        <li>Recurring internal dialogue that says “one more can’t hurt”</li>
        <li>Loss of sleep due to “just checking the shop one more time”</li>
        <li>Sudden interest in spreadsheets to track “value per draw”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>
      <p>You agree not to exploit bugs, reverse-engineer probabilities, or form secret forums discussing how to “rig” the drop table. (But if you do, send screenshots — we respect the hustle.)</p>

      <h2>5. Gambling Addiction Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>We joke. But addiction isn’t funny.</p>
      <p>If at any point you find yourself feeling compelled, anxious, or financially stressed because of this platform or any other gambling-like system, please seek help. You are worth more than your win rate.</p>
      <p>We strongly encourage you to visit <a href="https://aifs.gov.au/resources/resource-sheets/gambling-help" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gambling Help – AIFS.gov.au</a> for guidance, resources, and support.</p>

      <h2>6. Modification of Terms</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to amend these Terms at any time by editing this file and pretending it’s always been that way. You’re responsible for checking it occasionally. We won’t, obviously.</p>

      <h2>7. Final Clause</h2>
      <p>By using STACKED DECK, you acknowledge that randomness is an illusion, luck is a cruel mistress, and the only true win… is playing again.</p>
